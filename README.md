 Application Migration 



In a scenario where a database application accessed through a website faced high traffic and struggled to meet responsiveness requirements, I created a cloud-based solution to address the issue. Utilizing various resources such as a load balancer, Redis, RDS, WAF, etc., this infrastructure was implemented as code using Terraform on AWS. This solution effectively resolved the problem, providing the necessary scalability and performance for the application.
